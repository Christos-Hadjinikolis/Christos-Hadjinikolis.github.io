I am currently in Crete for my annual get away. Crete is an amazing island with many beautiful places to visit and a vast 
history that goes all the way back to the Minoans in 2700 BC.

One of the things I love doing whenever I am here is strolling around the city and taking pictures of the many hidden alleys, 
which reveal an amazing graffiti culture! I felt strongly about writing about it in my blog and I thought maybe I can do so 
by using some amazing images I gathered just last week in a style-transfer post. So this is it: **"Style Transfer in Heraklion"**
