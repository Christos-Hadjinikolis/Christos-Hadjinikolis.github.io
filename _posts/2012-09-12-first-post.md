I recently took the [AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/). I went through a lot of work in order to adequately prepare for this exam and I can tell you that it is indeed one of the hardest AWS certifications. Nevertheless, with proper preparation and a but of dedication you should be fine.

## How long do I need to study for this?
Well it depends; if you are an experienced Data Scientist and have been applying Data Science for about 3+ years then an hour per day for a month should be enough. This also holds if you are an engineer already exposed to the AWS infrastructure and services but are not familiar with Data Science topics. You see, this certification is labelled as hard simply because it is not just about AWS services. 50% of it is concerned with purely Data Science topics; the other 50% is about AWS services that support Data Science and ML activities. If you are neither exposed to Data Science nor to the AWS services then at least 2 months of studying is recommended.
