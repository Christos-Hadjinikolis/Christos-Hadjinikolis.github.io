The thing about writing a blog-post is that you are exposing yourself to the world; it feels a lot like flying for the first time.

You will be critisised! Some will appreciate your work. Others will say it's wrong, they 'll disagree&ndash;which is actually 
promoting healthy public debates and hence is a good thing&ndash;or they will just not care. Ultimately, blogging has nothing 
to do with being right neither it is about writing the perfect post. Put simply, it is just about doing it.

One of my favourite novels is "The Plague, by A. Camus". At the moment of writing I can't recommend this book enough given 
the global COVID-19 commotion. In this book, Camus' characters are engaged in helping and saving people in the name of no ideology; 
people dying so unfairly (especially children) is enough to move anyone to act irrespective of whether this is suported by some
moral justification.

There is one particular character, a side-character that came to mind when I sat down to write this post; Joseph Grand. 
Joseph is a fifty-year-old clerk operating for the city government. He lives an austere life, and in his spare time, he 
is writing a book. However, he is such a perfectionist that he ends up rewriting the first sentence over and over and never
gets to proceed any further. No words are ever good enough! What if meaning can be elevated to a higher level if a different 
wording is used. He is self-blocking himself feeling helpless and devastated.
 
We 've all been there&ndash;I am sure. If only he could let go of his perfectionism and move on to complete that first paragraph 
and write the first chapter. What would be the story that he would say? What morals and learnings would be revealed and shared?

I guess we will never find out about Joseph Grand, but my blogging journey begins here and now. Looking forward to hear 
your thoughts and I welcome all of your comments.
