<p>
  Having operated as a ML consultant over the last 5 years, and through my PhD before that, I have been exposed to a variety
  of problems and worked with professionals from both the academia as well as the industry across domains and departments.
  Currently operating as a Lead ML Engineer <a href="https://www.vortexa.com" >Vortexa Ltd</a>.
</p>
<p>
  From a Data Science and Research perspective, I am fascinated about the potential of Deep Learning and in particular its
  NLP applications as those are closer to my PhD research (click <a href="assets/pdfs/thesis.pdf" >here</a> for a copy of my PhD Thesis).
  I have also applied graph analytics extensively over the last 9 years&#8212both for the purpose of my doctoral thesis,
  as well as for solving relevant problems for the many clients I have worked for.
</p>
<p>
  From a software engineering perspective I am drawn to stream processing and relevant problems. I am an Apache Flink
  evangelist, which I have supported by running the respective <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apache-Flink-London-Meetup/" >meetup</a>
  in London for 4 years.
