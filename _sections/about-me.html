    With a PhD in Computer Science completed in 2014 and more than a decade of combined academic and industry experience under my belt, I have been on an engaging journey in the world of machine learning and AI. The last three years of this journey have been spent as a Lead Engineer at Vortexa Ltd, an AI-driven energy analytics company. Prior to this, I served as a Data Scientist and Data Engineer consultant at Data Reply Ltd, a leading provider of cutting-edge tech solutions.

    The mid-2010s, when AI re-emerged as a buzzword and was hailed as a magic solution for all business challenges, posed numerous obstacles. A recurring theme during this time was the inability to transition successful ML prototypes into production. The causes were numerous:

    A dearth of robust and scalable infrastructure capable of supporting ML models.

    An ever-widening gap between data scientists and software engineers, leading to misunderstood objectives and failed collaborations.

    Inadequate tools and methodologies to monitor, maintain, and improve models post-deployment.

    A general lack of understanding of the iterative nature of ML projects; a stark contrast to traditional software development.

    As these challenges became more apparent, the concept of the 'ML Engineer' began to take form. Though the term had been in circulation to some degree, it was around 2017 when it gained widespread recognition and began to define a new speciality within the industry. This role aimed to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering, focusing on implementing ML models into robust production environments.

    I quickly realized that my skill set and experience positioned me perfectly for this emerging role. As I embraced the 'ML Engineer' title, I embarked on an exciting new phase of my career. Now, I'm excited to share some of the valuable insights I've gleaned along the way.
