<p>
    I embarked on my journey in the world of machine learning and AI with a PhD in Computer Science from King's College London in 2014. Over the years, my career has spanned both academia and the industry, with significant roles in data science and engineering at companies like UBS and Vodafone through Data Reply Ltd, and now as a Lead ML Engineer at Vortexa Ltd. At Vortexa, I focus on developing ETL/ML pipelines for tanker operation forecasts, bridging the gap between niche research and real-world applications.

    The evolution of AI in the mid-2010s brought about unique challenges, especially in integrating ML prototypes into production. I encountered hurdles like the lack of robust infrastructure, the gap between data scientists and software engineers, and the need for improved tools for model maintenance. These experiences have shaped my understanding of the iterative nature of ML projects.

    As I navigate my role in the AI and ML fields, I am currently a committee member expert at the ISO's JTC'21 committee on AI standards, with plans to actively participate in editing teams within the Working Group 3. This step marks a new phase in my career, where I aim to contribute more significantly to AI standards and practices. My journey is a testament to continuous learning and adapting, and I look forward to sharing insights and experiences from this evolving path.
